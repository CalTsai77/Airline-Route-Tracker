# Airline-Route-Tracker
(Insert Demo Video here)

## Purpose and Description
- Creation of a fictional airline route tracker given a text file containing the following data: number of cities, name of cities, direct routes (source/destination cities, distance, cost)
- Provides a menu with three options:
  1. List cities and direct routes served by the airline (2 possible location files: Pennsylvania and Global cities)
  2. Find a route based on user input (source/destination cities, maximum cost, maximum distance, and an optional third city that must be included in the route)
     Display the valid routes in a filtered format based on number of hops, cost, and distance (smallest to largest)
  3. Exit the program (outputs a goodbye message to have a good and safe flight!)
- Incorporates Object-Oriented Programming, Searching Algorithms (DFS), and verification of user input via exception handling 
## How to Run the Program
- Local terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows) using the Java JDK

## Languages
